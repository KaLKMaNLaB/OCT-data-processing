# Titel: 
Research practicum optical coherence tomography
# Korte beschrijving:
In this RP you will work with an optical imaging method called optical coherence tomography (OCT). OCT can create cross sectional images of absorbing and scattering media. With OCT you can measure the structure of samples, but also dynamics of scatterers such as fluid flow and diffusion. It is the goal of this RP that you think of your own research that you want to perform s
# Voorwaarden:
For this RP you need to be efficient with Python. Knowledge of Signals and systems is preferred, but not essential.
